Project from my CPSC 304 course. Worked in collaboration of two classmates, who contributed code for the Best/Popular Posts section, Post liking/commenting, Community pages, as well as the Achievements functionality.

Highlights include:
- Express as backend framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
- Oracle SQL*Plus database
- working with Vanilla JavaScript (going back to the basics by building off plain HTML files and CSS)
