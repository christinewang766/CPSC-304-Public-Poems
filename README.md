Project from my CPSC 304 course. Worked in collaboration of two classmates, who contributed code for the Best/Popular Posts section, Post liking/commenting, Community pages, as well as the Achievements functionality.

**Highlights include:**
- Express as backend framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
- Oracle SQL*Plus database
- working with Vanilla JavaScript (going back to the basics by building off plain HTML files and CSS)

**Some of my specific contributions:**
- wrote mock data sql script that populates the tables on initialization (the databases.sql file)
- implemented buttons for: the reset button, delegating posts into post collections, delete post collections, joining a community, follow/unfollow profiles
- implemented forms for: user registering an account, user logging into an existing account, a profile editor that allows users to edit their previously made profile information, dashboard style creation, creating posts/poems, add contact information, creating post collections...
- implemented (table) displays for: listing a logged-in user's following/followers/mutuals, posts/poems, contact information, user's post collection, post collection posts, available communities to join as well as the # of members in each group
